			    <p>I believe that the worst thing a person can be is close-minded and I find travelling to be an enemy of close-mindedness. In a modern world we face all kinds of challenges and problem solving becomes very significant. I believe that the best kind of learning is from examples and that is another reason travelling is important - so we can see first-hand how other people and countries handled their problems and gain experience from that.  	
				I am very determined to travel the world during my lifetime. there are many other destinations on my go-to list like australia, Indonesia, South America and so on.

				<br>
				I am fascinated by technology. Not because I am a gadget freak (I am), or because I spend most of my days in front of a screen (I do). No. It’s got everything to do with my ideals. I think we humans have the potential to create a much better world, and I am convinced that technology can speed up the process. Drastically.
				Take Internet. It’s the classic example of a technology that changed the world – in less than fifty years, mind you. That’s the blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things. But there’s more. Much more. Solar cell technology is so far advanced nowadays that solving the world’s energy problem no longer feels like sciencefiction. 3D-printing technology renders wastefull mass production obsolete. Sensor technology in our smartphones brings medical diagnosis to places no doctor ever goes. I could go on. We live in extraordinary times. </p> </br>

					  <h4>Interests</h4>
       	Cars in general have been a passion for me and recently i have grown a liking for Tesla Cars.I believe Tesla’s existence have shown that electric cars are can be cool, can be compelling enough that you will choose this over an un-electric. I believe because of Tesla’s existence it has changed how we look at electric cars forever.
		Every time I see a Tesla car in the city whenever I’m walking, I smile. If you know me, you know I love innovation, I love a great product and I love good design. I love seeing care being put into the product. The nexus of empathy. The same way I feel when I hold an iPhone it’s the same way I feel whenever I’m inside a Tesla car. Tesla, making you save money, making the world a greener place, producing great ideas.
		Tesla is not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation to a whole new level.
